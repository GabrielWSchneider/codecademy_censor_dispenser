# codecademy_censor_dispenser

Greetings! This is my attempt to solve Codecademy's censor_dispenser challenge problem. It is one of my first projects using Git. Thanks for taking a look!

According to the instructions, the program "censor_dispenser" is supposed to censor particular words in a file. The files "email_one.txt", "email_two.txt", "email_three.txt" and "email_four.txt" comprise the test data used in this project.
